HELLO ALL:

prerequisites:
Python 3.X.
You can easily add Python to Windows path by downloading a recent version of Python, 
and then checking the box to "Add Python to PATH" during the installation.
You can download from official webpage https://www.python.org/downloads/

The PS4Xploit.exe may be taken  as a thread on some antivirus solution, this is a false/positive so dont worry :)

Just click on PS4Xploit.exe or self-host.py after Phyton installation it will generate a host server.

Enjoy :P!!!
